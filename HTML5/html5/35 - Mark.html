  <p>In 2009, Facebook made a bold grab to own everyone's content,
<em>forever</em>. This is the text they put in their terms of service:</p>

  <blockquote>
<big>You hereby grant Facebook</big> an <mark>irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license</mark> (with the right to sublicense) to <mark>use, copy, publish</mark>, stream, store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat, modify, edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works and distribute (through multiple tiers), <mark>any user content you post</mark> on or in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof subject only to your privacy settings or enable a user to post.
  </blockquote>

  <p><small>Fortunately, they've since backtracked and weakened the language considerably.</small>
Here's the <s>relevant section</s> today:</p>

  <blockquote>
<mark>You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook</mark>, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition: 1. For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you</mark> specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: <mark>you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content that you post</mark> on or in connection with Facebook. <mark>This license ends when you delete your content or your account</mark> unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.
  </blockquote>
